    <h1>What happens to flowers in 
        the winter?</h1>
    <div class="div1">
        <p>Most of leaves and flowers will shrivel, and lose their colour in the winter. The leaves of perennial plants and trees will fall, but the woody stalk and branches will endure.</p>
        <p>The winter is essential for the springtime survival of plants. In reality, for some plants to blossom successfully in the spring, they must be sown in the ground in the fall. Snowflakes are little ice molecules with tiny air bubbles trapped inside. More and more air is released to the ground as these flakes accumulate and continue to fall. Snow progressively releases moisture, air, sulphur, and nitrogen molecules when it melts.</p>

        <h2>Winterberry Holly</h2>
        <p>This shrub bursts with bright red berries that add a cheery color to the winter landscape. Some types are deciduous, while others are evergreen, retaining their leaves. No matter what kind, the gorgeous berries really pop against a field of snow. Plant both a "female" and "male" plant for pollination and the formation of berries.</p>
