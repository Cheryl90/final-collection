        <p>There is much folklore surrounding the Cornflower. People used to believe that the sky had sent down bits of itself to the fields and that's why they were scattered with blue flowers. Cornflowers can stop a nosebleed if picked on Corpus Christi Sunday. Water distilled from Cornflower petals was used for weak eyes.</p>
