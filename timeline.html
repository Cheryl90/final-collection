        <!-- <p>Early mornings in the garden are made better when flowers accompany the hour. Different types of flowers bloom at various times throughout the day. While many flowers open in late morning and afternoon, several flowers bloom in the earliest hours of the morning and remain open into afternoons or evenings. Several morning bloomers produce flowers that last for only a single day before they fade away.</p> -->
        <p>The process of flower blooming is influenced by various factors, including the type of flower, environmental conditions, and the specific species' characteristics. While the general stages of flower blooming can vary, here's a brief overview of how flowers might bloom throughout the day</p>

    <div class="div2">
        <h2>Early Morning</h2>
        <p>Many flowers begin their blooming process in the early morning hours. As the sun rises, it triggers physiological changes in the flower. Temperature and light levels play a crucial role in signaling the flower to open. Sunlight stimulates the production of hormones that initiate blooming.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="div3">
        <h2>Late Morning</h2>
        <p>During this time, flowers continue to open and reach their full bloom. The petals unfurl, revealing the flower's intricate structure. Bees and other pollinators are often attracted to the fully open flowers during these hours, as they offer nectar and pollen.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="div4">
        <h2>Afternoon</h2>
        <p>Some flowers may remain fully open throughout the afternoon, while others, especially those with delicate petals, may start to close in response to increasing temperatures or decreasing sunlight. Flowers that rely on pollinators for reproduction may be most active during these hours.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="div5">
        <h2>Evening</h2>
        <p>As the day progresses, some flowers may begin to close in the early evening. This closure can be a protective mechanism to conserve energy, retain moisture, or avoid nighttime predators. Flowers that are pollinated by nocturnal insects, such as moths, may open during the evening hours.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="div6">
        <h2>Night</h2>
        <p>While many flowers close at night, some species have unique adaptations to bloom specifically during nighttime. These flowers may release strong fragrances to attract nocturnal pollinators. Night-blooming flowers often have lighter-colored petals that stand out in the moonlight.</p>
