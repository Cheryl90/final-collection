        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p>Tiny drooping white flowers appear in late winter to early spring, sometimes while there's still snow (yes, that's how they got their name!). Plant a bunch of them for the best effect.</p>
        <p>Spring snowflakes are recognisable by their characteristic bell-shaped flowers, which overhang slightly and exude a sweet fragrance. The snowflakes can be found in floodplain forests and mixed deciduous forests during their blooming season. They form a spectacular sea of glowing white flowers when in bloom.</p>

        <h2>Meaning</h2>
        <p>Spring Snowflake (Leucojum) - purity, innocence, memory of youth. Small, white, delicate flowers that bloom and die early in the year, predictably, all have pretty much the same meaning</p>
    </div>

    <div class="div3">
        <p>Leucojum comes from the Greek Leukos, meaning a very bright and shining white. Another name for it is St. Agnes' flower.The innocence of early youth and the hopeful bright flowers of early spring have too many similarities to be too far of a leap from each other.</p>
